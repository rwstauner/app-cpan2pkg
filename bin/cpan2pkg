=head1 NAME

main - generating native linux packages from cpan

=head1 VERSION

version 2.120370

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ cpan2pkg
    $ cpan2pkg Module::Foo Module::Bar ...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Purpose of the program

This script is a glue application around cpan2dist, interacting with
your upstream distribution. When calling this script, it will:

=over 4

=item *

check whether it's alrady packaged by your vendor, and install from it
if that's the case.

=item *

otherwise, build a native package with cpan2dist - this implies that
there is a working C<CPANPLUS::Dist> backend for your OS.

=item *

once built, import the module in upstream repository.

=item *

then submit module to upstream buildsystem.

=back

And this, while dealing with dependencies, all the way long, repeating
steps over and over as needed.

Read L<this blog entry|http://jquelin.blogspot.com/2009/01/cpan-modules-native-linux-
packages.html> for this module rationale.
