=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a POE session responsible for dispatching events
from and to the interface.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

A list of modules to be build, to be specified during object creation.

=head1 EVENTS

=head2 new_module_wanted

    new_module_wanted( $modname )

Request C<$modname> to be investigated. It can already exist in this
run, in which case it won't be propagated any further.

=head2 module_ready_locally

    module_ready_locally( $modname )

Received when a worker has finished building / installing / fetching a
module locally, meaning it is available on this very platform.

=head2 module_ready_upstream

    module_ready_upstream( $modname )

Received when a worker has witnessed a module is available upstream,
either because it existed previously, or because it has been built on
build system.
